# Activity10 - VO2 data analysis

#Our question
This data has been captured to develop a model to estimate VO2max (response variable) based on a persons age, weight, gender and heart rate during a 20 minute submaximal cycling test (explanatory/predictor variables). This would allow future participants to not have to complete a strenuous maximal running treadmill test (which might deter some participants) and rather, to just complete a less strenuous submaximal test.

We can use multiple linear regression to develop this model.
